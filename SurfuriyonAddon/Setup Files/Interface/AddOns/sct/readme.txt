What is it? - A fairly simple but very configurable mod that adds damage, heals, and events 
(dodge, parry, windfury, etc...) as scrolling text above you character model, much like what already 
happens above your target. This makes it so you do not have to watch (or use) your regular combat 
chat window and gives it a "Final Fantasy" feel. 

Where did it come from? - The idea and base code came from the healthbar mod. I liked that mod a 
lot, but it really didn't do all that I wanted. So I decided to use it as a base to create my own 
mod purely as a learning experience. I've continued to work on it and think its now stands on its 
own merits, with almost none of the original code still intact. 

What's it look like? - See the image on the website: http://grayhoof.wowinterface.com/

- Ability to flag any event as critical
- Sliders for text size, opacity, animation speed, movement speed, and on scren placement

Where can I download it? - http://rjhaney.pair.com/sct/ 

How do I use it? - First unzip it into your interface\addons directory. It should be in its own 
folder called SCT. Now just run WoW and once logged in, type /sct to get the options screen. 

SCT_EVENT_CONFIG.LUA is used to setup custom message events. Please open up the file (notepad, 
etc...) and read the opening section to understand how to use it all.
PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN SCT. IF YOU DON'T READ IT AND USE IT, THEN
YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON A TON OF WHAT SCT HAS TO OFFER IN CUSTOMIZATION

/sctdisplay is used to create your own custom messages. 
Useage:
/sctdisplay 'message' (for white text)
/sctdisplay 'message' red(0-10) green(0-10) blue(0-10)
Example: /sctdisplay 'Heal Me' 10 0 0 - This will display 'Heal Me' in bright red

FAQ
How do I get My Crits or My Hits to show? SCT_EVENT_CONFIG.LUA has all of these
as examples you can simply uncomment (remove the --). You can open the file using any text tool (notepad, etc).

My custom event doesn't work. What's wrong? - Make sure you have the text exactly right, 
punctuation and capitalization matters. If you need help learning how to capture data, please see the 
examples or try this site http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial. If its still not working, please
read about SCT_Event_Debug and SCT_Event_List in the bottom half of SCT_EVENT_CONFIG.LUA to learn how 
to add almost any chat event to SCT's search capabilities

How do I change the text for parry, block, etc...? - open up the localiztions.lua file and look 
for the event you want to change. Then change the text to whatever you like. As of 4.1, you may also 
now add a custom event for these.

How do I get get text to scroll? I only see numbers! - Make sure the "Show Events as Message" 
option is unchecked. This is only if you want events to appear as static text (not scrolling/animated)

How do I change the fonts? - You can now select from four fonts on the options page. You can also change 
the font of message and apply the font to the in game damage font used for your damage (requires relog)
